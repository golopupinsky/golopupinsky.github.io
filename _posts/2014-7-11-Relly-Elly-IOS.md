title: Relly Elly development (iOS)

This project was started as a freelance job but soon after start client disappeared. And since he paid me nothing and no NDA was signed I decided to finish this project myself.

It took me about a year to complete it. 
Yes, that's too much for such a simple project. But first of all, I was doing it only when I had free time. And also I didn't have (and didn't plan to have) any ETA, this was just a slowly going hobby project.

Here's the list of things about this app that wanted to share:

I am going to write about each item above in this article. Not right now, but eventually.

### Introduction

The app was inspired by a well known Clear app. 
Main design idea was to get rid of the borders between cells and make them flat, even flatter than Clear did.
Removing borders was supposed to make app look smooth (and silky) and give it unique style. 

The second stylish feature was making cells animate their colors. And not just animate but do that preserving smoothness and borderlessness - i.e. animate colors syncronously. And since cell is not simply tinted with color but rather filled with gradient animation becomes somewhat tricky (and in some cases computationally heavy).

Next big design feature was gestures. Again, main reference here was  Clear app and many behaviours were borrowed from it.

At some point I've decided that this project should have a big brother on MAC and, if possible, PC. I've only managed to pull the MAC version and PC is most likely not happening. 
Anyway, mobile and
